There is 3 component:
- an execution platform
- storage
- a communication (messaging) platform

The execution can be done locally, on blockchain or by other means
(eg: helped by homomorphic encryption or zero-knowledge proofs)

The storage can be done on cryptographic (content addressed) file systems like BitTorrent, Git or IPFS for exemple.

Messaging can be done off grid, in a P2P fashion and/or using end-to-end encryption (eg: GPG)
